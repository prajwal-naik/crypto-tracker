# Challenges & Solutions

During the development of the Crypto Price Tracker, several challenges were encountered. This page documents these challenges and the solutions implemented to address them.

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge
The CoinGecko API has rate limits for free tier users, which could lead to errors if too many requests are made in a short period.

### Solution
- Implemented a caching strategy using React Query to minimize API calls
- Added error handling to gracefully handle rate limit errors
- Set reasonable refetch intervals (60 seconds) to avoid hitting limits
- Used a debounce function for the search feature to limit rapid API calls

## Real-time Data Updates

### Challenge
Balancing real-time data updates with performance and API rate limits.

### Solution
- Implemented a dual approach with both:
  - Automatic background refreshes at fixed intervals (60 seconds)
  - Manual refresh button for user-initiated updates
- Added visual indicators (loading states, timestamps) to keep users informed

## Responsive UI Design

### Challenge
Creating a dashboard that works well on both desktop and mobile devices with different screen sizes.

### Solution
- Utilized Tailwind CSS for responsive grid layouts
- Implemented a card-based design that adapts to screen size
- Used flexible layouts that reorganize based on viewport width
- Tested extensively on multiple device sizes
